Parallel-Range-Light is a parallel suffix array construction algorithm for integer alphabets.
It is a lightweight implementation based on the range algorithm from the Problem Based Benchmark Suite [PBBS](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pbbs/).
A rough description of the algorithm can be found in the following work.
